# Contributing to this repository

Development of the WAM-IPE code base follows the [gitflow strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LhTe8Mz6jM)

To add a new feature or respond to any issues in the issue tracker, you must first be added to the [SWPC-IPE developers group](https://github.com/SWPC-IPE).

New features, bug fixes, or code improvements are developed on a feature branch, whose base is off the most recent version of the development branch.
Once you are done with the work, you can submit a pull request to merge that feature back into development. At least one reviewer must approve the pull request.

## Tips for making the merging of your feature easier 
 * Actively participate in logging your activities on the issue tracker.
 * Reference the issue ID in the pull request
 * Make many small commits with meaningful commit messages so that other developers can see a clear story for development.
 * Be sure to run through the [march2013 simulations for coupled WAM-IPE](scripts/compsets/) demonstrating consistency between restart and continuous runs, and successful completion of 5 days of simulation.
