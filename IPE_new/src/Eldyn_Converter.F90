CONTAINS


! In this CONTAINS region ( before the END PROGRAM statement and after
! "CONTAINS" ), you can add whatever subroutines/functions you want and can call
! them within this program. Think of this area as your scratch space for quickly
! prototyping routines that accomplish what  you want. Once you're happy with
! the routine, then we can work on pushing it into the
! IPE_Electrodynamics_Class.F90 module.
