ncep_share  NCEP NEMS ATM component and top-level bits of DYN and PHYS 
            components.  FIM components re-use much of this code.  For now, 
            include entire code.  Later, use svn "externals definitions" to 
            replace this directory with a link to the NCEP repository.  That 
            is provided we can solve security policy issues and drill a "safe" 
            hole in the firewall protecting the NCEP repository.  John 
            Schneider is not completely pessimistic about an eventual 
            policy solution...  

components  FIM-specific component code.  This re-uses as much of ncep_share 
            as is practical.
