Markdown
--------

The webpage is generated from documentation in the NEMS repository.
Markdown is a human-readable, wiki-like syntax that can easily be
converted to other formats.  The Markdown files are converted to HTML
via Trent Mick's markdown2.py tool.  For details on Markdown, see:

* [Markdown website](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* [markdown2.py website](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/)

This documentation is stored in the NEMSLegacy doc directory.  The
website can be regenerated by doing this:

    svn co https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/nems/apps/(appname)/trunk
    cd trunk/NEMS/doc
    make

That creates the `README.html` and `README.css` that you view on your
browser.
